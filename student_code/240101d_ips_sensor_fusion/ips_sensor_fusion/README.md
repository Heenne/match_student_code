# ips sensor fusion - student package

## Overview
this submodule contains the students code for implementing a sensor fusion approach for indoor localization using an ultrasonic indoor positioning system. It implements two Kalman filters, one fusing relative data from an imu and the odometry as input to an amcl node, the other fusioning absolute data from the marvelmind ips and the amcl localization. A Seperate Node is used to set the amcl's initial pose when kidnapping is detected.

This package contains launch files for live sensor fusion as well as an offline replay version for tuning ekf and amcl parameters.

## Usage
### Live ips sensor fusion
* For scout 1:
    1. ssh: on scout, login as rosmaster:  `$ssh rosmatch@agilex`
    2. on scout: run `$roslaunch ips_sensor_fusion scout1_launch_all.launch`
    3. on mobilemaster: run `$roslaunch ips_sensor_fusion rviz_launch_withconfig.launch`
    4. on mobilemaster: run `$roslaunch ips_sensor_fusion mobilemaster_launch_all.launch`
* For scout 2:
    1. ssh: on scout, login as rosmaster:  `$ssh rosmatch@agilex`
    2. grand port permissions: `$sudo chmod 666 /dev/ttyACM0` and `$sudo chmod 666 /dev/ttyACM1`
    3. on scout: run `$roslaunch ips_sensor_fusion scout2_launch_all.launch`
    4. on mobilemaster: run `$roslaunch ips_sensor_fusion rviz_launch_withconfig.launch`
    5. on mobilemaster: run `$roslaunch ips_sensor_fusion mobilemaster_launch_all.launch`

### noEKF
Start launchfiles as in live ips sensor fusion, exchanging `scou1_launch_all.launch` with `scout1_launch_all_noEKF.launch` and `mobilemaster_launch_all.launch` with `mobilemaster_launch_all_noEKF.launch`. This may be used for independent amcl parameter tuning.

### Data recording
1. launch system as in live usage
2. on mobilemaster navigate to desired bagfile directory
3. use `$rosbag record -a -O bag_name` to record all messages, stop it using `str+c`

### Offline replay
1. For new, unfiltered bags, use the following commands to keep relevant topics and remove the rest, for alredy filtered bags proceed with step 2:
    * prepare ros bags by filtering relevant topics (provide topics to be kept):
    `$rosbag filter input_bag_name.bag output_bag_name.bag 'topic == "/scan" or topic == "/odom" or topic == "/cmd_vel" or topic == "/hedge1/beacons_pos_a" or topic == "/hedge1/hedge_imu_fusion" or topic == "/hedge1/hedge_imu_raw" or topic == "/hedge1/hedge_pos" or topic == "/hedge1/hedge_pos_a" or topic == "/hedge1/hedge_pos_ang" or topic == "/hedge2/beacons_pos_a" or topic == "/hedge2/hedge_imu_fusion" or topic == "/hedge2/hedge_imu_raw" or topic == "/hedge2/hedge_pos" or topic == "/hedge2/hedge_pos_a" or topic == "/hedge2/hedge_pos_ang"'` 
    * crop data to desired timestamp using `$osbag filter input_bag_name.bag output_bag_name.bag "t.secs <= 1673961654.509"` (example time)
2. launch rviz seperately via `$roslaunch ips_sensor_fusion rviz_launch_withconfig.launch`
3. start ips sensor fusion and replay of previously captured bag files by launching `$roslaunch  ips_sensor_fusion offline_replay.launch`
4. alternatively use `$roslaunch  ips_sensor_fusion offline_replay.launch bagfile:=other_bagfile.bag` to replay a specific bag file

## Config files
* `absolute_ekf_config.yaml`: contains the configuration for the kalman filter fusing absolute marvelmind and amcl poses
* `relative_ekf_config.yaml`: contains the configuration for the kalman filter fusing relative imu and odometry data
* `amcl_config.yaml`: contains the configuration for the amcl node
* `hedgehog_covariances.yaml`: contains the covariance matrices for the marvelmind hedgehog

## Launch files
most relevant launch files, further structure can be found in launch folder Readme.
* `scout1_launch_all.launch`: launch file to be run on scout computer in live usage
* `mobilemaster_launch_all.launch`: launch file for mobilemaster in live usage
* `offline_replay.launch`: launch file for offline replay of previously recorded data
* `rviz_launch_withconfig.launch`: launch file for rviz for offline and live usage

## Nodes
### amcl_recovery.py
this node detects kidnapping by measuring the distance betwenn the hedgehog and amcl pose and sets the amcl pose to the hedgehog pose if the distance is greater than a threshold. It also publishes the distance between the hedgehog and amcl pose as a diagnostic message.
#### Subscribed Topics

### beaconpos_publisher.py
This node publishes the beacon positions. It is used to visualize the beacons in rviz.

## Test setup
### Record floorplan using gmapping
1. disable sudo password prompt
2. synchronize ssh timing between agilex and rosmaster (on rosmaster: `$ssh agilex sudo date -s @$(date -u +"%s")`) check with shared terminal `$date`
